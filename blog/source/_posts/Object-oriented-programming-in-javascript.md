## What is Object-oriented Programming ## 

Object-oriented Programming refers to the programming style. It is a paradigm that is centered around object rather than functions. It exists in various programming languages since the 1970s and is still an important part as as of today. Other Programming languages that support Object-oriented Programming are: C#, C++, Java, Ruby, Python and many more

Most Javascript Frameworks such as Angular or React are designed to use Oop design. 

Although it is not nessesary to program in a OOP manner, it is a very valuable skill for every developer and is often required in a job. 

### Core Concepts  ###

There are four major concepts of OOP. These are as follows: 

* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism


``` javascript
let test = "This is a variable test";
alert(test);

function () => {
   return(x);
}
```
